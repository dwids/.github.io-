## Film Noir
Film noir, (French: “dark film”) style of filmmaking characterized by such elements as cynical heroes, stark lighting effects, frequent use of flashbacks, intricate plots, and an underlying existentialist philosophy. The genre was prevalent mostly in American crime dramas of the post-World War II era. (https://www.britannica.com/art/film-noir)

#### Detour (1945)
*Chance events trap hitchhiking nightclub pianist Al Roberts in a tightening net of death, deception and blackmail.*
Originally badly received this has gone on to be something of a classic of film noir. It's a short - 65 minutes - and interesting film, shot very quickly and on a small budget.
There's a poor copy on iView (!).
