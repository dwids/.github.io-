# Movie Suggestions
## Film Noir
*Voiceover: That dame was a cool as a vanilla ice-cream on a steamy New York day. I should never have trusted her, but she was an irresistible blonde spider. And me?  I was a sap and ever so slowly, I became her fly....*

Film noir, (French: “dark film”) style of filmmaking characterized by such elements as cynical heroes, stark lighting effects, frequent use of flashbacks, intricate plots, and an underlying existentialist philosophy. The genre was prevalent mostly in American crime dramas of the post-World War II era. [source](https://www.britannica.com/art/film-noir)


#### Detour (1945)
*Chance events trap hitchhiking nightclub pianist Al Roberts in a tightening net of death, deception and blackmail.*

Originally badly received this has gone on to be something of a classic of film noir. It's a short - 65 minutes - and interesting film, shot very quickly and on a small budget. There's an OK [copy on YouTube](https://youtu.be/tap67KjjPu8) as it's apparently in the public domain.  

## Horror (2015)
#### The Witch
*A family in 1630s New England is torn apart by the forces of witchcraft, black magic, and possession*.
DS Tip: It's in Olde English and can be a bit hard to understand; the subtitles help a lot.
