# Movie Suggestions
A list of suggested films, both old and new.  More info on the [different types of films (genres)](movie_genres.md) available.
## Film Noir

#### Detour (1945)
*Chance events trap hitchhiking nightclub pianist Al Roberts in a tightening net of death, deception and blackmail.*

Originally badly received this has gone on to be something of a classic of film noir. It's a short - 65 minutes - and interesting film, shot very quickly and on a small budget. There's an OK [copy on YouTube](https://youtu.be/tap67KjjPu8) as it's apparently in the public domain.  

## Horror (2015)
#### The Witch
*A family in 1630s New England is torn apart by the forces of witchcraft, black magic, and possession*.
DS Tip: It's in Olde English and can be a bit hard to understand; the subtitles help a lot.
