# This is a Heading 1
## H2 Quick Test

  You can also create quick links, like my page [[Good Trip List]]   Here is an external link being [a YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPBmshzmtVM) of **mine** from near *Apollo Bay.*  Inline `code` sample.
 
```sql
# For testing, ensure they have the text 'love' in the Songname
SELECT *
FROM SongsWithBook
WHERE Songname LIKE %love%'
````

### Heading 3 and some lists
Things to buy:
- Cat
- Dog with collar
- Something else

1. But something
2. Put a record into the database
3. Check you can find it via *browse* and then *search*.
#### Heading 4
Basic code/log_listing:

```
# Log file listing
Log begins
  1010 Start up
  1011 Error with socket
    Error code A3D
  1022 Exit return code -4
Log file ends
```

Here's a Powershell script code block

```powershell
# stop and start Print Spoooler
# must be run from Admin PowerShell prompt
#   https://www.lifehacker.com.au/2021/07/how-to-avoid-windows-printnightmare-security-threat/
param ($action)
if ($action -eq 'stop') {
Write-Host 'will be STOPPING and DISABLING the Spooler'
Write-Host '..stopping..'
Stop-Service -Name Spooler -Force
Write-Host '....Disabling auto_startup'
Set-Service -Name Spooler -StartupType Disabled
Get-Service -Name Spooler | Select-Object -Property *
}
```

I can draw your ==attention== to something or even indicate that it ~~no longer applies~~
